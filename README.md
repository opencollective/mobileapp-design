# Design for Mobile app
Here is where all the graphic assets for the mobile app live happily to make the workflow more efficient since all is now in GitHub.


## File Structure
To make it easier to know where is what you're probably looking for, I made a map to help you figure out what was going on in my brain:

```
mobileapp/ 
├── assets/
└── screens/
    └── Screens for mobile app, here


webapp-mobile/
├── assets/
└── screens/
    └── Screens for the mobile webapp


webapp-desktop/
├── assets/
└── screens/
    └── Screens for the mobile webapp

masters/
└── All the source .PSD, .SVG, .AI, etc

assets/
├── avatars/
├── backgrounds/
│   └── I've been going crazy with background gradients, so they get a folder of their own.
└── fonts/
    ├── icon-font/
    │   └── webfont files & docs for the iconfont
    │       └── proxima nova/
    │           ├── desktop/
    │           │    └── .OTF Files
    │           └── webfont/
    │               └── self explanatory
    └── icons/
        └── svg/
            └── all the icons/illustrations
```
