# Design for Mobile app

Here is where all the graphic assets for the mobile app live happily to make the workflow more efficient since all is now in GitHub.


## File Structure
To make it easier to know where is what you're probably looking for, I made a map to help you figure out what was going on in my brain:

```
design/ 
├── assets/
│   ├── avatars/
│   ├── fonts/
│   │   ├── icon-font/
│   │   │    ├── webfont files & docs for the iconfont
│   │   └── proxima nova/
